Django version 3.2, using settings 'djangotest.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

---------------------------------

Changing the port

By default, the runserver command starts the development server on the internal IP at port 8000.

If you want to change the server’s port, pass it as a command-line argument. For instance, this command starts the server on port 8080:

$ python manage.py runserver 8080
If you want to change the server’s IP, pass it along with the port. For example, to listen on all available public IPs (which is useful if you are running Vagrant or want to show off your work on other computers on the network), use:

$ python manage.py runserver 0:8000
0 is a shortcut for 0.0.0.0. Full docs for the development server can be found in the runserver reference.
-----------------------------
Automatic reloading of runserver

The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed.
